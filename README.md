# Prototype Bottleneck Model for Interpretable AI

A novel interpretable AI model that combines prototype-based learning with a bottleneck layer to create transparent, concept-driven decisions with minimal data requirements.

## Overview

This implementation provides a prototype bottleneck model that:
- **Learns interpretable prototypes** that represent key concepts in the data
- **Uses a bottleneck layer** to force the model to learn compressed, meaningful representations
- **Provides transparency** by showing which prototypes are most relevant for each prediction
- **Works with minimal data** through efficient prototype learning
- **Offers concept-driven explanations** for model decisions

## Key Features

- **Prototype Learning**: Automatically discovers and learns representative prototypes from the data
- **Bottleneck Architecture**: Forces the model to learn compressed, interpretable representations
- **Interpretability**: Provides clear explanations showing which prototypes influence each decision
- **Minimal Data Requirements**: Efficient learning with small datasets
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive visualizations for prototype analysis and decision explanations

## Architecture

The model consists of three main components:
1. **Encoder**: Maps input data to a latent space
2. **Bottleneck Layer**: Compresses representations and learns prototypes
3. **Decoder**: Reconstructs the input and makes predictions

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from prototype_bottleneck import PrototypeBottleneckModel

# Initialize the model
model = PrototypeBottleneckModel(
    input_dim=784,  # For MNIST digits
    bottleneck_dim=32,
    num_prototypes=10,
    prototype_dim=16
)

# Train the model
model.train(data_loader, epochs=100)

# Get interpretable predictions
predictions, prototype_weights = model.predict_with_explanations(x)

# Visualize prototypes
model.visualize_prototypes()
```
